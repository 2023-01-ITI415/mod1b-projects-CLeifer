 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
For this game, I wanted to combine the physics from Mission Demolition, the random movement from the tree in Apple Picker, and the concept of pickups from Roll a Ball to create a physics based arcade game where players can acquire points by shooting the ball from the slingshot into a basket and collect additional pickups to acquire a score. This is a casual arcade game that represents a real world sport like basketball.
